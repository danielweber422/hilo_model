Model of HiLo's thermal systems in EMPA's NEST building. Master Thesis of a coupled simulation between TRNSYS, CONTAM and MATLAB.

Abstract:
In this thesis, a model of the thermal energy systems of the NEST HiLo building is created through combination of three software programs. TRNSYS is responsible for general building thermal calculations and acts as a bridge between MATLAB and CONTAM. The latter is used to model natural and mechanical ventilation systems and the general interzonal air flows. MATLAB is used to implement a customised TABS (thermally active building system) model to fit the non-typical lightweight structural elements of the funicular floor and the thin shell roof. Additionally, it is used to enable a gateway for control inputs to the whole building model. Vertical and horizontal resolution simplifications for MATLAB's TABS model are presented, where the former is found to be justified, as computation time is saved and loss of precision is negligible. For the latter, no absolute conclusion can be drawn, as precision loss is bigger and justification depends on the users preferences on the models level of detail. First test simulations show expected results on interaction between the systems.
